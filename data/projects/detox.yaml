description: " Detoxification is a system, not a treatment. It is the simple answer to curing disease and unhappiness. It cleans you out, and uplifts and reconnects you to God and nature. It rids your body of acidosis, toxins, chemicals, sulfur,  mucus and harmful parasites. It rids the mind of unwanted thoughts and cleans the angers and emotions from your being.
Detoxification is true healing, eliminating all the toxins from the body which is holding us back to live a joyful, healthy life. After all, this elimination is the complete regeneration of the cells and tissues.
It is impossible for most things to work properly without a well functioning digestive system. Digestive troubles are  associated with emotional problems, fear, stresses, mental problems etc. The body is capable of building tissues back up."
epilog: "One of the laws of physics in this universe is the law of balance â€” homeostasis. The lower the energy of the food you eat, the lower your systemic energy becomes. This creates hypoactive or underactive tissues. The more energetic the foods are that you eat, the more vibrant and healthy you become. As we increase the energy of the physical body, we lift ourselves up out of despair and disease. This opens the senses to a whole new world of understanding and health. The vitality you can achieve is indescribable; it can only be experienced.

Keep your life simple. If you relax and truly investigate and experiment on yourself, you will discover the truth. Detoxification is the golden key. Use it to open the door to the kingdom of true vitality and God, and to experience
a disease-free life. 

Elimination is more important then any nutrition you will put in your body. The detox system is not a system of symptom treating. That is medical thinking. Pills, drugs cannot heal your body, they shove the problem back deep into your tissues and cells through the suppression of symptoms. The body then breaks down even more with time and creates even more serious life-threatening issues in the future. Medication do not cure. Only detoxification can.

Herbs help detoxify our bodies through the removal of acids and mucus as well as strengthening the systems, glands, and organs. Alkalize, detoxify and energize your body.

Heal yourself! "
