description: " Detoxification is a system, not a treatment.
Detoxification is true healing, eliminating all the toxins from the body which is holding us back to live a joyful, healthy life. After all, this elimination is the complete regeneration of the cells and tissues."
epilog: "One of the laws of physics in this universe is the law of balance â€” homeostasis. The lower the energy of the food you eat, the lower your systemic energy becomes. This creates hypoactive or underactive tissues. The more energetic the foods are that you eat, the more vibrant and healthy you become. As we increase the energy of the physical body, we lift ourselves up out of despair and disease. This opens the senses to a whole new world of understanding and health. The vitality you can achieve is indescribable; it can only be experienced. Keep your life simple. If you relax and truly investigate and experiment on yourself, you will discover the truth. Elimination is as important as any nutrition you will put in your body.

Heal yourself! "
