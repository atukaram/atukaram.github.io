description: "To all you lovely females!

I am inviting you to be an audacious embodied woman, who dare her desire, to reclaim her power, to flow in her own sensual energy which is her power house, to create the life she wants and be a receiver. 
To step into our power first we have to know how to own ourselves.

When we each develop intimacy with who we really are, what we want and need, and what our limits and boundaries are, then, and only then, can we enter into conscious agreements and mutually pleasurable dynamics - in community, in business, and in romance."

epilog: "Seldom we hear that we women will get to the point; several times in our lifes, renewal comes and that means we have to let go what we have been thought who we are or believed we are, we have to be. This is a death of the old persona, identity, which we can no longer continue to be and doesn’t matter how hard we push ourselves we have to meet with our powerlessness and exhaustion. When our soul is asking for coming home and to listen to our inner voice. This is the descent (the underworld) from our mind dominance and control. Until we get to know these darker flavours of our being we can not take responsibility for them. We have to come face to face by witnessing our own distraction. Once we stop exile our own darkness, the life energy can finally start to flow. There is a cleansing, release, that happens when we let die that which we are afraid of losing. In our life’s coming home to our own beauty, abundance,turn ons and unique sexual expression it’s a vital part of our heroine’s journey.

Follow no authority 
But your own true nature
Make a sacred fire
And throw on it all that you would use to harm yourself
Make kindling from shame
Let your dance be wild
Your voice honest
And your heart untamed
Be cyclical
Don’t make sense
Initiate yourself

From “dear Woman “by Aisha Wolfe

In order to find our creativity, motivation, power again we must surrender."
