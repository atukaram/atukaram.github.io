Are you a cracker person? I am! I LOVE crunchy things and like to eat crackers every day but I'm super picky because most crackers on the market are filled with junky ingredients - including some of the "healthy" ones. Plus I prefer eating grain free crackers and they're even harder to find.

That's why I offer here some of my favorite crackers.

## Crackers

- Carot crackers
- Root Beet crackers
- Kale crisps

## Sweets

- Cocos chips
