Why raw & living foods?

When you cook food, you lose up to 85% of it's nutritional value as the heat destroys the enzymes. Raw foods take less energy to digest, and provide the body with more energy. Living foods are a type of raw food, but they're still alive when you eat them. They consists of germinated seeds, baby plants, and ferments. Living foods are 10-30 times more nutritious than their adult counterparts, and have been found to alleviate a wide range of illnesses and disorders.
